# ClimaTrend: Multi-City Weather Pattern Analysis

A comprehensive weather data analysis project leveraging Python and Pandas to explore, clean, and visualize weather trends across multiple cities using over **1 million records** from the [Kaggle Weather Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/weather-data).

---

## Project Overview

This notebook-based project aims to:
- Analyze and compare temperature, humidity, and wind speed across cities.
- Perform time-series analysis using daily and hourly trends.
- Identify outliers and patterns using interactive visualizations.
- Generate insights useful for climate studies and forecasting applications.
